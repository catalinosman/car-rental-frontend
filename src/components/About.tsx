            <h3>This is my first fullstack project using  C#, .Net along with EntityFramework React with Redux Toolkit and TypeScript template. I started working by creating a diagram of the project and how I pictured it at that time, and also a plan of the steps I'd take. After connecting to the database first, I proceeded to create the model for every component, the interface, the implementation, and lastly the endpoints. I tested the endpoints with both Postman and SwaggerUI of course, after I implemented the authentication and authorization systems using the nuget packages from Microsoft for IdentityModels.Tokens with JwtBearer. This is my work so far and I'm quite satisfied with it, but of course there's always space for improvement. I'm also looking forward to studying the Azure Web Services concepts.</h3>
